# Process Redesign Proposals for EverSure

## Overview
This document proposes a set of changes to merge EverSure's traditional and digital processes into a single, more efficient process. Each proposed change addresses specific issues identified in the issue register and aims to improve overall process performance.

## Change 1: Unified Information System Implementation

### What will be added or dropped
- **Added**: A single, integrated information system that combines the functionality of CNTR, OPER, INSU, and AUIN
- **Dropped**: Separate systems (CNTR, OPER, INSU, AUIN) and redundant data entry

### What will be done differently
- Customer data will be entered once and accessible across all departments
- Contract information will be stored in a centralized database
- Lead information from both channels will be integrated
- Automated data validation will be implemented to reduce errors
- Customer history will be visible to all sales representatives regardless of channel

### Issues addressed
- **Issue 1: Inefficient Information Systems Integration**
  - Eliminates multiple disconnected systems
  - Reduces redundant data entry
  - Enables information sharing between business units

### Performance measures improved
- Error rates will decrease from 15% to 5% or lower in the digital process
- Back office processing time will be reduced by 10% as specified in merger benefits
- IT costs will be reduced by 20,000€ annually as specified in merger benefits
- Cross-selling opportunities will increase through better visibility of customer data
- Training time for staff will decrease as they only need to learn one system

### Related BPR principles/redesign heuristics
- **Technology enablement**: Using IT to eliminate routine manual activities
- **Integration**: Connecting processes that were previously fragmented
- **Standardization**: Creating uniform procedures and systems
- **Error prevention**: Designing systems to prevent errors rather than fixing them afterward

## Change 2: Hybrid Lead Generation and Qualification Process

### What will be added or dropped
- **Added**: Advanced lead scoring algorithm that incorporates traditional sales expertise
- **Added**: Pre-qualification step before offer preparation for all leads
- **Dropped**: Separate lead generation processes for traditional and digital channels

### What will be done differently
- Digital marketing team will generate leads for both channels
- Algorithm will be enhanced with criteria from traditional sales expertise
- Leads will be scored and categorized based on potential value and conversion likelihood
- High-value leads will be directed to traditional sales process
- Standard leads will be directed to digital sales process
- Automated reminders and follow-ups will be implemented for non-responsive leads

### Issues addressed
- **Issue 3: High Rate of "Bad" Leads in Digital Process**
  - Improves lead qualification by incorporating traditional sales expertise
  - Reduces wasted effort on non-converting leads
  - Directs resources to leads with higher conversion potential

### Performance measures improved
- Ratio of "good" leads will improve by 20% as specified in improvement potential
- Conversion rate of digital leads will increase from 10% to at least 15%
- Non-response rate will decrease from 70% to below 50%
- More efficient resource allocation between high-value and standard leads
- Higher overall return on marketing investment

### Related BPR principles/redesign heuristics
- **Task elimination**: Removing unnecessary effort on poor-quality leads
- **Task composition**: Combining related tasks into a composite task
- **Triage**: Directing different types of cases to appropriate resources
- **Empower**: Giving workers more decision-making authority in the process

## Change 3: Streamlined Customer Report and Offer Preparation

### What will be added or dropped
- **Added**: Automated report generation using the unified information system
- **Added**: Standardized offer templates for different customer segments
- **Dropped**: Manual preparation of customer reports by sales admin
- **Dropped**: Separate offer preparation processes for traditional and digital

### What will be done differently
- Customer reports will be generated automatically using predefined templates
- Sales representatives will have direct access to report generation
- Standard offers will be automatically suggested based on customer data
- Sales representatives can customize standard offers for high-value clients
- Digital back office will handle all contract processing regardless of channel

### Issues addressed
- **Issue 2: Excessive Waiting Times in Traditional Process**
  - Eliminates 1-week waiting time for customer report preparation
  - Reduces offer preparation time through standardization and automation

### Performance measures improved
- Customer report preparation waiting time will be reduced from 1 week to near-zero
- Offer preparation processing time will be reduced from 5 hours to 1-2 hours
- Cycle time efficiency will improve from 8.5% to at least 15% for traditional process
- Traditional business can target 20% more customers as specified in improvement potential
- Time to validate customer data for digital clients will be reduced by 30% as specified

### Related BPR principles/redesign heuristics
- **Automation**: Using technology to perform tasks
- **Case manager**: Making a single person responsible for the entire case
- **Resequencing**: Changing the order of tasks
- **Parallelism**: Performing tasks in parallel rather than sequentially

## Change 4: Integrated Contract and Payment Processing

### What will be added or dropped
- **Added**: Unified contract processing workflow for both channels
- **Added**: Automated payment tracking and reconciliation
- **Dropped**: Separate back office processes for traditional and digital contracts

### What will be done differently
- A single back office team will handle all contracts regardless of origin
- Contract templates will be standardized but customizable
- Customer data verification will be partially automated
- Payment tracking will be integrated with the unified information system
- Automated alerts will be generated for missing payments

### Issues addressed
- **Issue 1: Inefficient Information Systems Integration**
  - Consolidates contract processing in a single workflow
- **Issue 2: Excessive Waiting Times in Traditional Process**
  - Reduces contract processing time through standardization

### Performance measures improved
- Back office processing time will be reduced by 10% as specified in merger benefits
- Error rates in contract processing will decrease to 5% or lower
- Payment investigation time will be reduced through better tracking
- Staff utilization will improve through workload balancing

### Related BPR principles/redesign heuristics
- **Case-based work**: Organizing the work based on cases rather than functions
- **Integration**: Connecting processes that were previously fragmented
- **Exception handling**: Separating normal cases from exceptions
- **Control relocation**: Moving controls into the process

## Summary of Expected Benefits

1. **Efficiency Improvements**
   - Reduced waiting times throughout the process
   - Improved cycle time efficiency from under 10% to at least 15%
   - 10% reduction in back office processing time
   - 30% reduction in customer data validation time

2. **Cost Savings**
   - 20,000€ annual IT cost savings from unified system
   - Reduced training and maintenance costs
   - More efficient resource allocation
   - Lower error rates and rework

3. **Business Growth**
   - 20% increase in customer reach for traditional business
   - 20% improvement in ratio of "good" leads for digital business
   - Increased cross-selling opportunities
   - Higher conversion rates across both channels

4. **Customer Experience**
   - Faster response times
   - More consistent service across channels
   - Personalized offers based on comprehensive customer data
   - Fewer errors in contract processing

These proposed changes collectively address the major issues identified in the as-is processes and create a merged process that leverages the strengths of both the traditional and digital approaches.
