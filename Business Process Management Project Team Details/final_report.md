## 1. Introduction

EverSure has been providing insurance to businesses for more than 20 years. With their deep understanding of customers and ability to offer the "right" products, they have experienced increasing revenues over the past 10 years. However, with the emergence of many new digital companies, they have found it harder to acquire new customers. As part of their strategy, EverSure acquired a digital competitor.

This report analyzes the current traditional and digital processes at EverSure, identifies key issues, and proposes a set of changes to merge these processes into a single, more efficient process. The goal is to leverage the strengths of both approaches while addressing their respective weaknesses to create a unified process that improves overall business performance.

## 2. As-Is Process Models

### Traditional Process

The traditional sales process at EverSure begins with sales representatives identifying potential customers and submitting requests to sales admin for customer reports. After receiving reports, sales representatives book meetings with potential clients, with a 90% success rate. Following meetings, interested clients (60%) receive offers prepared by sales admin and modified by sales representatives. Customers may accept (50%), decline (35%), or request modifications (15%). Accepted contracts are processed by back office in the CNTR and OPER systems, followed by payment processing with a 5% error rate.

### Digital Process

The digital process begins with the marketing team generating leads through earned (white papers, case studies) and paid (Google ads) methods. An algorithm filters out 50% of leads as irrelevant before assigning the remainder to sales representatives. Sales reviews web form data and selects standard offers in a highly standardized process (10 minutes per case). Customers may accept (15%), decline, request contact, or not respond (70% after 3 weeks). Accepted offers are automatically sent to back office for processing in the INSU system, followed by data entry into the AUIN system with a 15% error rate.

## 3. As-Is Process Analysis

### Cycle Time Efficiency Calculations

Cycle time efficiency is calculated as the ratio of value-added time (processing time) to the total cycle time (processing time + waiting time).

**Traditional Process:**
- Total Processing Time: 21 hours (best case)
- Total Waiting Time: 216 hours (best case)
- Total Cycle Time: 237 hours
- Cycle Time Efficiency: 21 / 237 = 8.86%

With offer modifications and payment errors:
- Total Processing Time: 24 hours
- Total Waiting Time: 312 hours
- Total Cycle Time: 336 hours
- Cycle Time Efficiency: 24 / 336 = 7.14%

**Digital Process:**
- Total Processing Time: 10.27 hours (best case)
- Total Waiting Time: 152 hours (best case)
- Total Cycle Time: 162.27 hours
- Cycle Time Efficiency: 10.27 / 162.27 = 6.33%

With contact request:
- Total Processing Time: 14.27 hours
- Total Waiting Time: 168 hours
- Total Cycle Time: 182.27 hours
- Cycle Time Efficiency: 14.27 / 182.27 = 7.83%

**Assumptions:**
- Working week of 40 hours
- Sequential process flow (no parallel activities)
- For activities without specified waiting times, waiting time is assumed to be 0
- For activities with specified total time but unspecified processing time, reasonable estimates are made

### Issue Register

**Issue 1: Inefficient Information Systems Integration**

EverSure operates with multiple disconnected information systems across the traditional and digital business units. The traditional business uses CNTR and OPER systems, while the digital business uses INSU and AUIN systems. This lack of integration creates redundant data entry, increases error rates, and prevents information sharing between business units.

Evidence:
- Traditional process uses CNTR for contract registration and OPER for customer data management
- Digital process uses INSU for initial data entry and AUIN for customer data management
- AUIN system performs the same functions as OPER but with a higher error rate (15% vs. 5%)
- No indication of data sharing between traditional and digital processes

Impact:
- Higher error rates in digital process (15% vs. 5% in traditional)
- Duplicate customer information across systems
- Increased training requirements for staff
- Missed cross-selling opportunities
- Higher overall IT costs

**Issue 2: Excessive Waiting Times in Traditional Process**

The traditional sales process suffers from significant waiting times at multiple stages, particularly in customer report preparation (1 week waiting) and the period between report receipt and client meeting (2 weeks total time with only 3 hours of processing). These delays extend the overall cycle time and reduce efficiency.

Evidence:
- Customer report preparation: 4 hours processing time but 1 week waiting time
- Client meeting scheduling and preparation: 3 hours processing time but 2 weeks total time
- Offer preparation and approval: 5 hours processing time but 3 days total time
- Cycle time efficiency calculation shows traditional process at only ~8.5% efficiency

Impact:
- Extended sales cycle reduces competitiveness
- Potential customers may find alternative solutions during waiting periods
- Sales representatives handle fewer leads per month (100 visits vs. 1000 leads in digital)
- Opportunity cost of missed potential customers (estimated 20% improvement potential)

**Issue 3: High Rate of "Bad" Leads in Digital Process**

The digital process suffers from inefficient lead qualification, with 50% of leads filtered out by the algorithm and only 10% of the remaining leads that receive offers converting to contracts. Additionally, 70% of leads never respond, resulting in significant wasted effort and resources.

Evidence:
- 50% of initial leads are filtered out by the algorithm
- 70% of leads that receive offers never respond (considered "dead" after 3 weeks)
- Only 10% of leads that receive offers convert to contracts
- Company believes they could improve the ratio of "good" leads by 20%

Impact:
- Significant wasted effort in lead generation and offer preparation
- Low return on marketing investment
- Sales representatives' time spent on non-converting leads
- Reduced overall profitability of digital business

## 5. Conclusion

The analysis of EverSure's traditional and digital processes has revealed significant opportunities for improvement through process merger. The traditional process offers deep customer understanding and high-value contracts but suffers from excessive waiting times and inefficiency. The digital process provides speed and volume but struggles with lead quality and higher error rates.

By implementing the proposed changesâ€”unified information system, hybrid lead generation, streamlined report and offer preparation, and integrated contract processingâ€”EverSure can create a merged process that leverages the strengths of both approaches while addressing their respective weaknesses.

The expected benefits include improved efficiency, cost savings, business growth, and enhanced customer experience. These improvements align with EverSure's strategic goals of maintaining their competitive edge in an increasingly digital market while leveraging their traditional strengths in customer understanding and relationship management.
