# Detailed Guide for Creating Digital Process BPMN Model

## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating the BPMN model for EverSure's digital insurance sales process using bpmn.io. Follow these instructions precisely to create a compliant BPMN diagram that meets all project requirements.

## Accessing the Tool

1. Open your web browser and navigate to https://demo.bpmn.io/new
2. You will see a blank canvas with a palette of BPMN elements on the left side
3. Save your work frequently using File > Save Diagram (select .bpmn format)

## Digital Process BPMN Model - Step by Step

### Step 1: Set Up Pools and Lanes

10. Add a "Data Store" below
11. Name it "INSU System"
12. Add an association from "Enter data into INSU system" to this data store

### Step 7: Add Contract Generation and Data Entry
1. Add an "Exclusive Gateway" to the right of the verification tasks
2. Name it "Data verification complete?"
3. Draw two sequence flows from this gateway:
   - One going back to "Verify customer data" (create a loop)
   - One going right to a new "Service Task" (name it "Generate contract")
4. Label these sequence flows:
   - "No"
   - "Yes"

4. Label these sequence flows:
   - "No (85%)"
   - "Yes (15%)"
5. From "Investigate and correct errors", draw a sequence flow back to "Enter data into AUIN system"

7. From "Accept modified offer" to "Receive acceptance"
8. From "Contact customer for bank information" to "Provide bank information"
9. From "Provide bank information" to after "Contact customer for bank information"
10. From "Send contract to customer" to "Receive contract"

### Step 11: Add Data Objects
1. Add data objects to represent information flowing through the process:
2. Add a "Data Object" near "Generate earned leads"
3. Name it "Lead data"
4. Add a "Data Object" near "Review web form data"
5. Name it "Web form data"
6. Add a "Data Object" near "Select best standard offer"
7. Name it "Standard offer"
8. Add a "Data Object" near "Modify standard contract"
9. Name it "Modified offer"
10. Add a "Data Object" near "Verify customer data"
11. Name it "Customer verification data"
12. Add a "Data Object" near "Contact customer for bank information"
13. Name it "Bank information"
14. Add a "Data Object" near "Generate contract"

16. Connect these data objects to relevant activities using associations

### Step 12: Review and Finalize
1. Check that all activities are properly connected with sequence flows
2. Verify that all message flows between pools are correctly aligned
3. Ensure all gateways have appropriate outgoing paths with labels
4. Confirm that all data objects and data stores are connected to relevant activities
5. Verify that all time annotations are included
6. Align elements horizontally and vertically for a clean layout
7. Ensure consistent spacing between elements
8. Adjust the size of pools and lanes if needed
9. Make sure all labels are visible and not overlapping

### Step 13: Save in Required Format
