# Issue Register for EverSure's As-Is Processes

## Overview
This document identifies and analyzes three major issues in EverSure's current traditional and digital processes. Each issue is described in detail, with supporting evidence from the process analysis and assumptions clearly stated.

## Issue 1: Inefficient Information Systems Integration

### Description
EverSure is operating with multiple disconnected information systems across the traditional and digital business units. The traditional business uses CNTR and OPER systems, while the digital business uses INSU and AUIN systems. This lack of integration creates redundant data entry, increases error rates, and prevents information sharing between business units.

### Evidence
- Traditional process uses CNTR for contract registration and OPER for customer data management
- Digital process uses INSU for initial data entry and AUIN for customer data management
- AUIN system performs the same functions as OPER but with a higher error rate (15% vs. 5%)
- Back office staff must be trained on multiple systems
- No indication of data sharing between traditional and digital processes
- Potential customers with existing contracts are not cross-referenced between systems

### Impact
- Higher error rates in digital process (15% vs. 5% in traditional)
- Duplicate customer information across systems
- Increased training requirements for staff
- Missed cross-selling opportunities
- Inefficient use of IT resources maintaining multiple systems
- Higher overall IT costs

### Assumptions
- The systems are not currently integrated or sharing data
- The higher error rate in the digital process (AUIN system) is partly due to system design/usability issues
- A unified IT solution would reduce both processing time and error rates
- The estimated 20,000€ annual cost savings from a common IT solution is primarily from reduced maintenance and support costs

## Issue 2: Excessive Waiting Times in Traditional Process

### Description
The traditional sales process suffers from significant waiting times at multiple stages, particularly in customer report preparation (1 week waiting) and the period between report receipt and client meeting (2 weeks total time with only 3 hours of processing). These delays extend the overall cycle time and reduce efficiency.

### Evidence
- Customer report preparation: 4 hours processing time but 1 week waiting time
- Client meeting scheduling and preparation: 3 hours processing time but 2 weeks total time
- Offer preparation and approval: 5 hours processing time but 3 days total time
- Offer response: 2 weeks average waiting time
- Cycle time efficiency calculation shows traditional process at only ~8.5% efficiency
- Company estimates that faster processes could help them reach 20% more customers

### Impact
- Extended sales cycle reduces competitiveness
- Potential customers may find alternative solutions during waiting periods
- Sales representatives handle fewer leads per month (100 visits vs. 1000 leads in digital)
- Reduced customer satisfaction due to long response times
- Opportunity cost of missed potential customers (estimated 20% improvement potential)

### Assumptions
- The 1-week waiting time for customer reports is due to backlog/resource constraints, not a necessary part of the process
- The 2-week period between report receipt and client meeting includes scheduling delays and is not entirely customer-driven
- Faster processing would not negatively impact the quality of customer reports or meetings
- The 20% potential improvement in customer reach is achievable through process optimization

## Issue 3: High Rate of "Bad" Leads in Digital Process

### Description
The digital process suffers from inefficient lead qualification, with 50% of leads filtered out by the algorithm and only 10% of the remaining leads that receive offers converting to contracts. Additionally, 70% of leads never respond, resulting in significant wasted effort and resources.

### Evidence
- 50% of initial leads are filtered out by the algorithm
- 70% of leads that receive offers never respond (considered "dead" after 3 weeks)
- Only 10% of leads that receive offers convert to contracts
- Digital marketing team spends 6 hours generating leads
- Sales representatives spend 10 minutes per case preparing offers
- Company believes they could improve the ratio of "good" leads by 20%
- Digital contracts have much lower value (500€ vs. 20,000€ for traditional)

### Impact
- Significant wasted effort in lead generation and offer preparation
- Low return on marketing investment
- Sales representatives' time spent on non-converting leads
- Reduced overall profitability of digital business
- Inefficient resource allocation

### Assumptions
- The current algorithm for filtering leads is not optimally designed
- Better lead qualification criteria could be developed
- The high rate of non-response (70%) indicates poor targeting or irrelevant offers
- The digital marketing team's efforts could be better directed with improved analytics
- The 20% improvement in "good" lead ratio is achievable through process and algorithm improvements

## Summary of Key Issues

1. **Inefficient Information Systems Integration**
   - Multiple disconnected systems (CNTR/OPER vs. INSU/AUIN)
   - Higher error rates in digital process
   - Missed opportunities for data sharing and cross-selling

2. **Excessive Waiting Times in Traditional Process**
   - Long delays in customer report preparation and meeting scheduling
   - Very low cycle time efficiency (~8.5%)
   - Reduced competitiveness and customer reach

3. **High Rate of "Bad" Leads in Digital Process**
   - 50% of leads filtered out initially
   - 70% of remaining leads never respond
   - Only 10% of leads with offers convert to contracts
   - Significant wasted effort and resources

These issues represent significant opportunities for process improvement through the merger of the traditional and digital processes at EverSure.
